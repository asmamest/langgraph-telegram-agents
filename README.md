# LangGraph & Multimodal Telegram Agents Workshop

Welcome to the ultimate hands-on workshop for building multimodal Telegram agents using **LangGraph**! Whether you’re a beginner or have some AI experience, this workshop will guide you from fundamentals to a fully working prototype.

---

## 🚀 Goals

1. **Beginner-friendly**: Start with a crash course breaking down the core principles of LangGraph.  
2. **Hands-on learning**: Build as you learn—every concept ties to a working project.  
3. **End-to-end journey**: Go from “What’s LangGraph?” to “Look what I just built!”

## 📚 Workshop Structure

### Step 1: Build the Foundation
- Master core principles of LangGraph: simple chains → ReAct loops → router patterns.
- Learn the logic behind advanced AI workflows.
- Understand modular design for AI pipelines.

### Step 2: Hands-on Labs in Google Colab
- **TTS (Text-to-Speech)**: Turn text into natural-sounding audio.  
- **STT (Speech-to-Text)**: Convert speech input into text.  
- **VLMs (Vision-Language Models)**: Process images and text together.  
- **Image Generation**: Create visuals from textual prompts.  

### Step 3: Build Your Telegram Agent
- Integrate all components into a fully functional Telegram bot.  
- Customize workflows, commands, and responses for your use case.  
- Deploy your agent with minimal setup using Google Colab.
